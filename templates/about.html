            <p id="about_p">Hello, I'm Chrissy Sitterson, LCSW-CP, and I'm delighted to share a bit about myself with you.<br>
                With a graduate degree from the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) and a strong<br>
                commitment to fostering holistic well-being, I've dedicated years to helping individuals on<br>
                their journey to healing and personal growth.<br><br>

                Beyond my professional identity, I am a wife and a mother of five wonderful children. This role<br>
                has provided me with a deep understanding of the joys, complexities, and challenges that come<br>
                with life's various chapters. It's a role that has also instilled in me a deep sense of empathy, as I<br>
                understand that each person's journey is unique.<br><br>
                
                With my years of experience and the personal insights I've gained, I strive to be not only a knowledgeable<br>
                therapist but also a compassionate and dedicated guide on your path to well-being. I'm here to support you,<br>
                no matter where you are in your journey, and to help you navigate life's challenges.<br><br>
                Thank you for considering me as your partner on this path to healing and growth.</p>
